#### Requirements

- Use `create-react-native-app` to implement the views in the above screenshots as closely as you can to the original designs

- You're free to use any libraries you feel are appropriate

- Park data should be pulled from the following API endpoint and used to populate both the list and detail views: https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/rn-code-challenge/databases/(default)/documents/parks

- The header bar background color should be `#8c1d40`

- The header bar font color should be `#ffc627`

- Parks should be sorted alphabetically on the list screen

- Pressing on a park row in the list screen should navigate the user to the park's detail view

- Pressing the **Back** button on the detail screen should navigate the user back to the list view

- The displayed `acres` and `elevation` values should have commas separating thousands (eg: `1,000` instead of `1000`). If `acres` or `elevation` are not numbers, the values should be displayed without any additional formatting

- Pressing the **More Info** link on the detail screen should open the link in Safari (_does not_ need to open within the AZ Parks app itself)

- Your solution will be tested on the **iOS iPhone 8 Simulator** - there's no need for you to test on Android and/or older iOS versions/devises

#### Time Expectations

Please do not spend more than 4-6 hours on this project. If you're unable to complete all of the requirements within that time, submit what you've completed and let us know what you got hung up on. An incomplete solution **will not** automatically disqualify you from this opportunity!

#### Submitting Your Work

Send an email to `jason@ackmanndickenson.com` containing a link to your repository (GitHub, Bitbucket, Google Drive, etc). Good luck and thank you for your time!
